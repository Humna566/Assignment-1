POL 222 FINAL ESSAY ASSIGNMENT ?Humna KhanPOL 222: Introduction to Canadian Politics? Student Number: 301330145 ?Professor: Andrew Heard? March 20, 2020?                              The immigration system in Canada plays a considerable role in maintaining the strength ?of the country's economy and population.  However, it can be argued the process which gives ?immigrants their status and claims to be fair has an underlying economic agenda, which ?undervalues the individuals in the system and is more concerned with the economic value each ?category potentially will produce. This can explicitly be seen in the Temporary Worker Program ?that plays a significant role in Canada's need for flexible short term labor. Yet, the government ?undervalues the needs and protection of these individuals. Furthermore, it is seen in the ?government's failure to create a feeling of social cohesion by excluding TFW who are in the ?process of gaining permanent residency. Lastly, it is proven in how Canada cares more about ?economic immigrants' potential value than focusing on the realities they face upon arriving. ?      The Temporary Foreign Worker Program was introduced in 1955, and it was primarily ?established to fulfill the need for domestic workers in both high skilled and low skilled positions  ?Canadians couldn't fill themselves.? ? Later it included a subsection called the Seasonal ?Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) to fulfill jobs in the rural sector as more Canadians ?shifted to urban work.? ? However, as the TFW program was reaching its peak, Canadian citizens ?became frustrated that the program was stagnating wages since many employers could hire these ?workers for less than minimum wage and  many feared that it took jobs away from Canadians. ?Thus in 2014, the Canadian government put dramatic cutbacks on the program, shrinking it ?dramatically and creating new regulations and criteria.? ? However, the newly developed status of ?being a TFW can be argued to have exploitive factors in its structure as the Canadian ?government focused primarily on the economic value that could be derived from the individuals. ?The first way this can be seen is by looking at who these programs are targeting. It has been ?proven that the TFW program is largely advertised in countries with low wages, most notably in ?the global south, including dominantly in India and the Philippines.? ? By picking workers from ?these countries who are reliant on these wages to support their families, it can be argued the ?government targets individuals who must comply with their temporary status by going back to ?their county. Thus it can be argued that the classification of TFW, which appears to be neutral, ?has a corrupt racialized element.? ? This observation leads back to Canada's main priority, which ?is neoliberal values, that is fulfilled by the fact that The government exploits explicitly ?vulnerable workers from the global south who must be compliant in order to foster economic ?prosperity while protecting the labor market. ?A second way the Canadian government has explicitly added factors that exploit individuals in ?the  TFW program to fulfill neoliberal values is through the restrictions placed on low skilled ?TFW regarding the application process for permanent residency. For this group in the program, ?their status restricts them specifically from PR with the only pathway being the Provincial ?Nominee Program, which is very narrow.? ? Furthermore, the program that allows permanent ?status adds further restrictions by favoring those who are educated and have high English ?proficiency. Language barriers are doubly significant in the TFW program since it is a massive ?indicator of not just a chance at PR but also if immigrants will get in the program.? ? Language has ?a significant effect on the perceived value of immigrants. This factor has only increased with ?Canada's aim to use the immigrant program for their economic value, thus picking those that ?would be valuable to the labor market.? ? However, this aspect of the TFW can explicitly be seen ?as exploitative for how counterintuitive it is. This is proven by the fact that Canada wants high ?standards for their temporary foreign workers; however, only for a short time that would benefit ?the labor market. Thus even if permanent labor is needed, the immigrants within the TFW are ?seen as disposable labor. Which further proves the system only cares for economic value than ?individuals within the program. ?      Another subsection of the low skilled TFW program is the  Seasonal Agricultural ?Workers Program (SAWP), which has even more significant restrictions.? ? Since their status in ?the country lasts for such a short time, those who show interest in PR rarely receive the ?opportunity. This restriction is pointedly seen in a statistic that states that "after ten years of ?participating, 2% of workers under the SAWP had achieved permanent status.? ? Many would ?give the counter-argument that the point of the TFW program is to have short term labor; thus, ?low PR for these individuals makes sense. However, to refute this concern, it can be argued the ?main problem with the TFW is that the Canadian government makes it appear that these ?classifications show neutrality even in a program that is meant for temporary labor. However, in ?reality, it can be argued these statuses placed by the immigration system are used to sort out ?between those Canada seen as economically worth permanent residency, thus not giving a fair ?chance to those who show an interest in staying in the country.? ? Therefore, there is an economic ?agenda for each position which Canada further stabilizes by preventing resources from going to ?those who classify as low skilled TFW to create a stable job market and fulfill their economic ?goal at the expense of the individual immigrants. ?      Additionally, another way the TFW program shows Canada's commitment to neoliberal ?values that subsequently undervalues the immigrants in the program is looking at the new ?guidelines that were implemented in 2014.? ? These guidelines are unique to each province, but ?the main factors that must be fulfilled by employers applying for workers under the program ?include completing a Labour Market impact assessment (LMIA) that ensures that Canadians ?weren't filling those positions to ensure the stability of the Canadian job market.? ? Next, ?immigrants in the program must sign a contract that makes sure they can't work for anyone else ?during their work term by binding them to a single employer.? ? However, this aspect has gone ?under fire for leaving immigrants susceptible to abuse. This is because making individuals reliant ?on their employer for pay, accommodations, and status can lead to significant cases of ?exploitation. This is applicable to both high skilled and low skilled TFW "who face direct impact ?to [their] health, safety, and psychological well being.? ? This mistreatment includes being forced ?to do the worse jobs or not being paid enough, all under threat of being reported causing TFW to ?become compliant.? ? Thus this factor of the TFW program has resulted in a lot of immigrants ?facing these hardships and losing their voice even though official occupational health and safety ??(OHS) have been breached.? ? Although it is essential to recognize that there have been NGOs ?and unions who have ensured better protection for many immigrants and ensured no lines get ?crossed. This aid is largely disproportionate as many immigrants, especially rural workers, go ?unchecked.? ? This is largely attributed to the "inadequacy of the communication pathways ?between federal institutions that manage the immigration program and provincial institutions ?responsible for ensuring compliance to labor legislatures".? ? This lack of communication and ?continued abuse of many TFW counters the argument made by many who advocate that tying a ?TFW to one employer ensures that they can't impact Canada's economy if their mobility is ?restricted. This shows how neoliberal values power the immigration system and leads to a ?program that is laden with loopholes that cause abuse. Furthermore, the unequal distribution of ?NGOs and unions and misgiving of the communication system within the immigration system ?shows how, by large, the TFW program is focused more on gaining flexible labor than individual ?immigrants. ?      Another way that the TFW program has factors in its system that allow for abuse, ?especially for low skilled TFW, is that the immigrants with this status have hardly any access to ?integrating and settlement services.? ? However, as argued above about how susceptible these ?immigrants are to abuse, it can be argued that the  TFW  program is a significant fraction of the ?immigration that should have the services available. This is because, mostly, Temporary Foreign ?Workers don't have the same social connections that many permanent immigrants have that help ?navigate their time in Canada.? ? Furthermore, by allowing more settlement services, it would ?reduce TFW who get abused by employers by giving them access to services that will better help ?them understand their rights and terms of services.? ? Another critical thing to recognize is that ?recently in 2019, the government has introduced legislation to allow migrants to leave abusive ?workplaces.? ? This is an important step forward; however, it can be argued that many immigrants ?may still feel scared to come forward about abuse. Furthermore, combined with inconsistent ?communication within the immigration system and the lack of settlement-services available to ?TFW, an argument can be made that a massive scale shift must be made within the Canadian ?government who isn't sensitive to immigrant's short term needs. Thus,  more large scale changes ?must be made to a system that has allowed these transgressions to happen all under the dominant ?goal of potential economic prosperity that could be derived from the TFW program and the ?immigration system as a whole to fulfill neoliberal values.  ?      Moreover, another way that Canada's neoliberal values are apparent in regards to the ?immigration system is seen in how the government fails to integrate TFW who are gaining ?permanent residency, thus undermining feelings of social cohesion. Firstly it is important to ?recognize high skilled TFW are able to obtain permanent status with a bit more success than low ?skilled TFW through the Two-Step Program to change their status to permanent.? ? However, ?when navigating through life in Canada, many immigrants feel primarily no connection to the ?country they are trying to gain PR in and face many hardships that make them feel disposable ?within Canadian society. The first factor that this can be attributed to is that in order to get group ?attachment an individual must form social ties. However, many TFW are under substantial strain ?to remain productive since many came to Canada through high personal cost and face many ?challenges to get PR status.? ? In other words TFW "thus 'embody capitalism' by exploiting their ?own bodies and social relations to remain active and employable."? ? By putting so much strain ?on these individuals to be economically lucrative, it can be argued that the Canadian government ?undermines the feeling of social cohesion by making immigrants feel like they are only cogs in ?the labor market. This lack of connection fueled further because even though high skilled TFW ?are beginning the process to gain PR, their status still prevents them from settlement services that ?could help connect them to the community, language, and Canadian society as a whole.? ? ?Another way that adds to their lack of connection to Canadian society is due to the vulnerability ?of their position, especially since a significant factor of gaining permanent residency is how well ?you do in your status as a TFW. And since high-skilled individuals are also tied to one employer, ?there is room for abuse, thus creating fear and making it hard for many immigrants to develop ?strong roots.  This feeling of being included yet also excluded has been called "differential ?exclusion" and is felt by TFW who experience this by being incorporated in the labor market; ?however, not in the larger picture of Canadian society.? ? Thus although the system allows high ?skilled TFW to gain PR, it can be argued  The government cares more about the economic value ?they provide while in the program then aiding them to transition. This results in a large group in ?society who feel like outsiders in a country that claims to value solidarity within the country. ?      Another way TFW status has terrible implications for social cohesion is that within the ?broader Canadian society is seen through the racial discrimination TFW face, especially when ?there is an economic downturn.? ? When this happens, TFW are seen as threats, and it disrupts ?workplace relations.? ? The reason why this is significant is because it shows how these ?immigrants are seen as a part of the Canadian labor market, however, when against scrutiny and ?placed on a hierarchy, TFW compared to other citizens are seen as inferior. Thus this shows how ?for TFW trying to gain permanent residency their status undermines social cohesion and ?immigrant integration into society. One argument made is that in reality, these exclusionary ?elements are built into the system, which is further proven "because of the requirement that such ?workers develop or maintain a transnational community identity (as a temporary resident)."? ? ?This negatively cements this feeling of being stuck in between neither their own country or ?Canada. All in all, this shows Canada's commitment to incorporating TFW as a part of the labor ?market. However, when it comes to integrating them into society, they are seen as less valuable ?as potential citizens, thus why very little is being done to help these individuals in a transitional ?stage to create strong ties with the country. ?      Another way that shows how Canada is dominated by neoliberal values that use the ?immigration system for economic gain at the expense of individuals is seen in how the system ?further extends to exploit the group of immigrants that Canada does choose for permanent ?residency. This is seen firstly by looking at how in 1966, there was a fundamental shift in the ?Canadian immigration policy. Since then, the main priority was to acquire individuals that were ?deemed beneficial to the economy.? ? That is why when the White Paper on Immigration ?introduced the three streams of immigrants who get permanent residency, the most significant ?and most valued was the economic stream, which makes up the largest sect in the system to get ?PR.? ? This is because these individuals are deemed to be ideal immigrants because they bring ?skills or could fill a job position in the country.? ? This emphasis on skills is put into force by the ?competitive assessment process that is the Canadian point system.? ? In this system, individuals ?are tested "English and French skills, education, work experience, and other factors that have ?been shown to help them prosper in Canada."? ? These competitive categories show Canada's ?emphasis on striving for the perfect immigrant who can quickly become lucrative in the ?economy. ?      However, the main problem is that Canada's standards for the PR system through the ?point system do not align with the labor market requirements, and it has been recorded that there ?is a discrepancy in the employment of many immigrants as a result.? ? Even after economic ?immigrants get in through the complicated process of obtaining status through a process that ?values skills; these immigrants face a hard time settling because of the discrepancy between the ?immigration guidelines and the employment criteria.? ? This causes frustration for immigrants ?whose experience got them in, but won't give them higher paid jobs. It also shows how the ?Canadian immigration system that advertised for  them to apply to the program primarily sees ?them for their economic values but is failing in the integration process."Some have described ?Canada's efforts to attract qualified workers trained abroad as seduction and abandonment."? ? ?One way this is seen especially is that immigrants are getting initial lower wages than Canadian ?citizens for the same positions. The problem is that mainly education outside of Canada is not ?recognized. And although those who do complete programs get jobs quickly, there are still many ?immigrants who are not able to get these resources and upgrade.? ? Furthermore, because ?employers dominantly favor Canadian acquired skills and are more concerned with losing value, ?the hiring trend of immigrants is going downAE6.? ?  This results in a lot of highly skilled ?immigrants to work menial jobs as pressures to support their family force them to take jobs that ?require low experience.? ? Thus, this is apparent exploitation of the immigration system, more ?specifically the economic stream, to get highly educated and skilled individuals for their ?potential of aiding the economy but not supporting them in becoming a part of the country. Thus ?it can be argued the country's priorities for the immigration system must be shifted. Moreover, ?more information should be given to potential permanent citizens who pass the point system ?about the limiting labor market criteria for immigrants before they migrate here through great ?personal cost.? ? ?      All in all, Canada's commitment to economic stability that exploits the immigration ?system and the individuals within the program is at odds with a country the claims to be built on ?immigrants. This is seen in how the system purposefully targets vulnerable individuals from the ?global south to be apart of the TFW program. Furthermore, it is seen in how low skilled TFW ?has substantial barriers in gaining permanent residency. Yet, the government still places high ?standards on individuals who get in the TFW program. Thus it can be argued the system is ?exploitive since it values the potential economic benefits of these workers but still sees them as ?largely disposable labor. These clearly exploitative actions by the government are continued by ?the fact that the government fails to create a more secure environment for TFW, which has ?caused many cases of abuse of these short term laborers. Moreover, the government's failure to ?give value to the individuals in the immigration system is further highlighted by the country's ?shortcomings in regards to integrating TFW who are gaining PR. This creates a subgroup of ?people in society who feel excluded and inferior and results in deteriorating social cohesion. ?Lastly, the country's exploitation of the immigration system extends to the economic immigrants ?who, although make up the largest sect of immigrants to receive permanent residence, face many ?challenges in the labor market upon arrival. This is related to Canada's failure to inform these ?individuals before applying about the narrow standards of the job market that requires primarily ?Canadian education leading many immigrants who are deemed valuable by the system but still ?have to work menial level jobs.  ?What is Equity-centered design??It is a problem-solving process that is designed to acknowledge that there are many systems at ?play simultaneously and this process allows us to reflect on how various factors influence ?behaviour and outcomes. It allows us, as a team, to notice and reflect on our assumptions, ?actions, and insights all while we ideate and test our prototype. This semester, a large focus for ?our group has been to challenge our assumptions and biases and so, this process has been vital. ?From our team's desktop research, we found that these issues are substantially apparent among ?seasonal temporary foreign workers, prompting us to focus our attention towards agricultural ?workers who make up a majority of temporary foreign workers. Additionally, the COVID-19 ?pandemic has only amplified feelings of social isolation felt by workers and highlights the ?existing labour abuse in this sector.?We want to highlight that our project will address the following points of the City of Surrey's ?Sustainability Charter:?The future lives here and that should include the hard work and livelihoods of migrant workers ?who often feel alienated in our community despite their significant contributions to the Canadian ?economy. ?Since the inception of the Migrant Support Squad, we've spent countless hours researching. ?From our research, we've found that there are four main themes:??**based on our culminated interview insights at the midpoint So - Based on our research, we ?identified three main topics that we wanted to address. One of them includes the cultural and ?language barriers faced by agricultural workers in Surrey. English literacy affects all facets of ?life in Canada and our gathered insights show these barriers exacerbate the negative experiences ?felt by TFWs. The second topic is around the fear of employer retaliation. Because of the power ?imbalance between employers and their employees, it has become common for TFWs to carry ?the fear of being sent home and placed on a migrant worker blacklist. Our third and final topic is ?around the issues of accessibility. Agricultural workers work long hours and in remote locations ?where access to transportation can be limited. As a result, they face increased difficulty in ?accessing resources like community agencies that are only available on the corporate 9AM - ??5PM time periods.?? ?The first insight we got about our end user is that the majority of agricultural workers come from ?the rural areas of Mexico. We also learned that most of the seasonal agricultural workers don't ?know anything about their living and working conditions until a week prior to their departure, or ?sometimes not until they reach Canada.] necessary? ?To visualize who are target population is We created this user persona for our midpoint process ?book:?*	Our user is Carlos Garcia who works in Surrey from February to September. ?*	? Carlos's main goal is to be able to provide for his family back home. He aims to put his ?kids through a post-secondary education and get a good job.?*	A problem Carlos is facing is long working hours and chronic back and knee pain from ?his agricultural job. ?*	Some of his needs include learning more about what support is available for him while ?he's in Surrey so that he can take care of his mental and physical health. ??** Disclaimer goes here ** ?Lastly before we continue, we want to state that As a part of recognizing our assumptions and ?biases, we want to acknowledge that none of us come from Spanish-speaking backgrounds. To ?get a more accurate portrayal of Latin (?) culture, we connected with people in the community to ?get a better idea of how we can incorporate a cultural aspect to our venture. ?After the mid-point presentation, the feedback from the panelists centred around the delivery of ?information and the social engagement aspects of our food truck. From the feedback, we decided ?to focus on Spanish-speaking migrant workers to tailor the resources and have a community ?specialist on the truck so support can be delivered on the farms.  [PROTOTYPE phase]?A significant issue we faced during this phase was our doubts about the feasibility of a food ?truck. So, we considered the following pivot to [a more upstream approach by providing an ?orientation service employer could pay for in order to educate TFWs.] ?We presented our ideas to Dr. Evelyn Grez, a labour studies prof here at SFU and co-founder of ?Justicia for Migrant Workers, a well-known Canadian activist group. We first showcased our ?orientation service. Dr. Grez provided three key insights. [new slide; TEST phase]?Key insights re: focusing on BC employersMoving forward with the food truck idea, in phase seven we used the mission model canvas ?introduced in class to layout our venture designer mission is to overcome accessibility hurdles ?through a mobile unit while also creating a safe place through the approachable nature of a food ?truck.we will also use its social layout to allow the resources we hand out to be more digestible. ??"Our mission is to help agricultural temporary foreign workers in the community through sales ?of specialty pastries and ethnic foods. Our proceeds will go towards funding resources to ?support agricultural TFWs in achieving a safe, healthy, and secure life while in Canada."?After establishing the general intentions and resource avenues of the food truck, we wanted to ?create tangible representations of these services through storyboarding. Our first prototype ?storyboard illustrated how our service would play out in a real-life setting. Our next step was to ?book interviews with our end users and community partners to get feedback on its feasibility.  ?The next thing we thought about was what we wanted to sell on our food truck. We realized that ?there were many challenges with providing hot meals, such as food certifications/permit, cost of ?equipment, and the cost of ingredients. As we didn't want to lose the food aspect of our idea, we ?decided to pivot and, instead, considered distributing coffee and Latin pastries by partnering up ?with local bakeries to preserve the cultural connection which we think is vital for creating an ?engaging social environment for Spanish-speaking TFWs.?? ?We left this phase still having worries around the sustainability aspect and barrier we might face ?through this venture, so we decided to reach out to our community partner, Adrienne Bale from ?DiverseCity, for feedback and guidance.?Prior to the meeting with Adrienne, we wanted to learn about Diversecity's mobile unit because ?we saw it as a feasible example of what we wanted to achieve. After sharing our storyboard, she ?shared with us her positive outlook on the idea of garnering social connection through food. She ?viewed our food truck solution as a unique and effective approach of distributing resources ?compared to theirs, which was more about marketing diversecity's program.  ?? ?Adrienne raised a noteworthy concern about obstacles we may face with employers when ?deploying our food truck and conducting business on farms. We want to acknowledge that there ?are organizations that already focus on the empowerment of TFWs when it comes to their rights. ?Thus we wanted to focus on helping TFW navigate through existing resources on topics that ?focused more on fundamental aspects, like right to medical care, that would help improve TFW ?health outcomes during their time in Canada. So we developed a phone number infographic that ?lists useful, relevant contacts for TFWs. Adrienne commented that this resource would be ?valuable and we collaborated with the DiverseCity team to further enhance it. ?By the end of this phase we also established our stream of revenue that would sustain our food ?truck This led to an idea that we would only be functional for outreaches during weekend ?evenings due to the availability of TFWs, leaving the rest of the week free. [Thus, we decided to ?utilize our food truck and broaden to a wider customer base. The plan was to sell our Latin ?american desserts garnering revenue that we would put towards the information and food we ?would provide to TFWs on our outreach. We would also be open to receiving donations from the ?public. These weekday trips would also allow the opportunity to spread public awareness about ?the realities of TFWs in Canada and their essential contribution to the Canadian ?economy.][Farmer's market storyboard]?From the feedback from Tim, Paola and Terri, we ended up with the following problem ?statement:?Problem Statement: Spanish-speaking agricultural TFWs, during their work season in Surrey, ?deserve more support in with navigation navigating through existing resources so that they can ?achieve better health outcomes. ?? ?Our instructor, Terri, also raised the concern of how well-received our social enterprise food ?truck idea would be in farmers markets and public events. To test this, we reached out directly to ?the market manager and President of Surrey's Urban Farmers market, Anna Hall. She responded ?to our email with great interest and informed us of important registration dates. This led us to ?believe that it may be possible for our venture solution to operate in farmers markets and other ?high-traffic locales, like university campuses and annual community events such as Surrey's ?Fusion Festival and Party for the Planet, to not only generate revenue but also foster public ?awareness. ?Around this time, we'd updated our problem statement and had created scenarios for our service ?but were unsure of the accuracy of our storyboard prototypes. So we decided to share them with ?Felipe and Victor from Dignidad Migrante who have first-hand experience of conducting trips to ?farms which employ temporary foreign workers. ?During our interview with Felipe and Victor from Dignidad Migrante, we used the feedback ?matrix to help us assess our prototype. Felipe played an essential role in giving us insight on the ?cultural aspect of our idea since we are an outsider to this culture. He appreciated our ?consideration to incorporate Latin American pastries and resources in Spanish in order to build a ?cultural connection with TFWs. Felipe also acted as our proxy of agricultural workers as he also ?pointed out the concept of extraction. On top of the added barriers by COVID-19, we didn't want ?to offer empty promises and we didn't want to strain the relationships that Dignidad Migrante ?had built over the years. ?So we understood that we were not able to get in contact directly with end users but we ?appreciated Dignidad first hand experience on this issue. ?                              Bibliography ??"
